# Feature Specifications

This directory contains feature specifications created using the Spec-Driven Development methodology.

## Structure

Each feature gets its own directory with the naming convention: `###-feature-name`

Example structure for a feature:
```
specs/
â””â”€â”€ 001-data-ingestion-core/
    â”œâ”€â”€ spec.md              # Feature specification (/specify output)
    â”œâ”€â”€ plan.md              # Implementation plan (/plan output)
    â”œâ”€â”€ research.md          # Technical research
    â”œâ”€â”€ data-model.md        # Data models and schemas
    â”œâ”€â”€ quickstart.md        # Validation scenarios
    â”œâ”€â”€ contracts/           # API contracts and interfaces
    â””â”€â”€ tasks.md             # Task breakdown (/tasks output)
```

## Workflow

1. **`/specify`** - Creates the initial `spec.md` with requirements and user stories
2. **`/clarify`** - Updates `spec.md` with clarifications and resolved ambiguities
3. **`/plan`** - Generates `plan.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, and `quickstart.md`
4. **`/tasks`** - Creates `tasks.md` with actionable implementation tasks
5. **`/analyze`** - Validates consistency across all artifacts
6. **`/implement`** - Executes the implementation based on the specifications

## Branch Management

Each feature specification corresponds to a feature branch:
- Branch name: `###-feature-name` (matches directory name)
- Specifications are developed in feature branches
- Merged to main after completion and validation

## Status

ðŸš§ **Ready for Feature Development** - Use `/specify` to create the first feature specification.

*Feature specifications will be created here as we develop the HX Data Ingestion Project.*
