## Enhanced SDD Workflow

This workspace supports the complete 7-step Spec-Driven Development process:

### 1. `/constitution` - Project Principles
Establish the non-negotiable governing principles that guide all development decisions.

### 2. `/specify` - Requirements Definition
Define WHAT you want to build and WHY, focusing on user stories and functional requirements.

### 3. `/clarify` - Ambiguity Resolution ⭐ NEW
Interactive Q&A session to resolve under-specifications and ambiguous requirements.

### 4. `/plan` - Technical Implementation
Define HOW to build the feature, including architecture, tech stack, and data models.

### 5. `/tasks` - Task Breakdown
Break down the implementation into actionable, sequenced tasks.

### 6. `/analyze` - Consistency Validation ⭐ NEW
Cross-check all artifacts for consistency, constitutional compliance, and quality.

### 7. `/implement` - Execution
Execute the implementation based on validated specifications and plans.

## Key Features

### Latest Enhancements
- **`/clarify` Command**: Addresses under-specification through targeted questioning
- **`/analyze` Command**: Validates consistency across spec, plan, and tasks
- **Cross-Platform Scripts**: Both Bash and PowerShell support
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Automatic validation against project principles

### Quality Gates
- **Ambiguity Detection**: Identifies vague or missing requirements
- **Consistency Checking**: Ensures alignment across all artifacts
- **Constitutional Validation**: Enforces non-negotiable principles
- **Coverage Analysis**: Verifies complete requirement-to-task mapping

## Getting Started

### Initialize Your First Feature

1. **Set Project Principles** (recommended):
   ```
   /constitution
   ```

2. **Define Your Feature**:
   ```
   /specify
   ```

3. **Clarify Requirements**:
   ```
   /clarify
   ```

4. **Plan Implementation**:
   ```
   /plan
   ```

5. **Validate Consistency**:
   ```
   /analyze
   ```

6. **Execute**:
   ```
   /implement
   ```

## Branch Management

Each feature specification corresponds to a feature branch:
- Branch naming: `###-feature-name` (matches spec directory)
- Develop specifications in feature branches
- Merge to main after completion and validation

## Environment Integration

The workspace is configured to work with:
- **Cursor AI**: Primary development agent
- **GitHub**: Version control and collaboration
- **Cross-platform development**: Linux, macOS, and Windows support
