## Documentation Standards

All documentation follows the Spec-Driven Development principles:
- **Intent-Driven**: Focus on WHAT and WHY before HOW
- **Living Documents**: Updated as specifications and implementations evolve
- **Traceable**: Clear connections between requirements, design, and implementation
- **Testable**: Documentation includes measurable criteria and validation scenarios
