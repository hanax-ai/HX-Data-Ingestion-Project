# V2 Feature Epics Explanation

**Purpose:** Detailed explanation of the four SDD-compliant feature epics for V2 system design

## Epic 001: Core System Optimization

### **Overview**
This epic addresses the fundamental architectural and dependency issues identified in the Discovery phase, focusing on creating a maintainable, efficient core system.

### **Problem Statement**
The current prototype has 204 dependencies (~2.5GB footprint), monolithic architecture, and lacks proper configuration management - making it unsuitable for production deployment.

### **Key Components**

#### **Dependency Reduction (BL-001)**
- **Current State:** 204 dependencies including heavy packages like torch (2.1GB)
- **Target State:** <50 core dependencies with optional groups `[crawl]`, `[rag]`, `[ui]`
- **Approach:** Audit all dependencies, categorize as core/dev/unnecessary, implement modular installation

#### **Modular Architecture (BL-008)**
- **Current State:** Monolithic `doc_ingest.py` with tight coupling
- **Target State:** Separate modules for URL detection, crawling, chunking, database operations
- **Approach:** Refactor with clear interfaces, dependency injection, unit testability

#### **Configuration Management (BL-020, BL-021)**
- **Current State:** Hardcoded values, scattered configuration, basic .env files
- **Target State:** Centralized config system with environment-specific overrides
- **Approach:** Pydantic BaseSettings, hierarchical configuration, validation

### **Success Criteria**
- Container image size reduced by 40%
- All modules independently testable
- Zero hardcoded configuration values
- Clear separation of concerns

## Epic 002: Security Framework

### **Overview**
This epic establishes a comprehensive security posture for the V2 system, addressing authentication, authorization, data protection, and compliance requirements.

### **Problem Statement**
The prototype lacks any security framework - no authentication, plaintext secrets, no compliance checking, and no data protection mechanisms.

### **Key Components**

#### **Secret Management (BL-007)**
- **Current State:** Plain .env files, HX_DIP_SECRET without formal management
- **Target State:** Integration with HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager
- **Approach:** Centralized secret storage, automatic rotation, access auditing

#### **Authentication & Authorization**
- **Current State:** No access controls
- **Target State:** OAuth 2.0 authentication with role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Approach:** API Gateway integration, JWT tokens, user session management

#### **Compliance Framework (BL-004)**
- **Current State:** No robots.txt compliance, unrestricted crawling
- **Target State:** Configurable compliance checking with robots.txt respect
- **Approach:** Robots.txt parser, configurable enforcement modes, crawl delay implementation

#### **Data Protection**
- **Current State:** No encryption, local storage only
- **Target State:** TLS for transit, encryption at rest, field-level protection
- **Approach:** Certificate management, database encryption, key rotation

### **Success Criteria**
- Zero plaintext secrets in production
- 100% robots.txt compliance rate
- All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- Comprehensive access control and auditing

## Epic 003: Scalability Architecture

### **Overview**
This epic transforms the single-process prototype into a distributed, horizontally scalable system capable of handling production workloads.

### **Problem Statement**
The prototype uses local ChromaDB, single-process design, and lacks network resilience - preventing it from scaling beyond development use.

### **Key Components**

#### **Production Vector Database (BL-002)**
- **Current State:** Local ChromaDB, single-node storage
- **Target State:** Production vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate, or Qdrant)
- **Approach:** Database selection criteria, migration strategy, connection pooling

#### **Network Resilience (BL-003)**
- **Current State:** No timeouts, no retry logic, susceptible to network hangs
- **Target State:** Comprehensive timeout/retry with exponential backoff
- **Approach:** Circuit breaker pattern, connection pooling, failure monitoring

#### **Microservices Architecture**
- **Current State:** Monolithic application
- **Target State:** Containerized microservices with independent scaling
- **Approach:** Service decomposition, API design, container orchestration

#### **Performance Optimization**
- **Current State:** Basic async implementation
- **Target State:** Optimized for high throughput with caching and batching
- **Approach:** Connection reuse, intelligent caching, batch processing

### **Success Criteria**
- Horizontal scaling capability
- <2 second response times for RAG queries
- 99.9% system availability
- Graceful handling of network failures

## Epic 004: Operations & Observability

### **Overview**
This epic establishes comprehensive monitoring, logging, and operational capabilities to ensure the V2 system can be effectively managed in production.

### **Problem Statement**
The prototype relies on print statements for logging, has no monitoring, lacks proper error handling, and provides no operational visibility.

### **Key Components**

#### **Structured Logging (BL-006)**
- **Current State:** Print statements to stdout
- **Target State:** Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- **Approach:** Replace all print() calls, implement log levels, centralized logging

#### **Error Handling (BL-005)**
- **Current State:** Silent failures, success exit codes on errors
- **Target State:** Proper error propagation with non-zero exit codes
- **Approach:** Specific exception handling, graceful degradation, error reporting

#### **Monitoring & Metrics**
- **Current State:** No system monitoring
- **Target State:** Comprehensive metrics with Prometheus/Grafana dashboards
- **Approach:** Performance metrics, health checks, alerting systems

#### **Input Validation (BL-017, BL-018)**
- **Current State:** Broad exception handling, no input validation
- **Target State:** Specific exception handling with Pydantic input validation
- **Approach:** Data models for validation, specific ChromaDB exceptions

### **Success Criteria**
- Structured logs for all operations
- Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) <15 minutes
- Proactive alerting for critical issues
- Complete operational visibility

## Epic Relationships & Dependencies

### **Implementation Order**
1. **Epic 001 (Core System)** - Foundation for all other epics
2. **Epic 002 (Security)** - Can proceed in parallel with Epic 003
3. **Epic 003 (Scalability)** - Depends on modular architecture from Epic 001
4. **Epic 004 (Operations)** - Integrates with all other epics

### **Cross-Epic Dependencies**
- **Configuration Management** (Epic 001) enables **Secret Management** (Epic 002)
- **Modular Architecture** (Epic 001) enables **Microservices** (Epic 003)
- **Structured Logging** (Epic 004) integrates with all other epics
- **Network Resilience** (Epic 003) supports **Error Handling** (Epic 004)

### **Shared Components**
- **API Design** spans Epic 002 (security) and Epic 003 (scalability)
- **Database Integration** spans Epic 001 (architecture) and Epic 003 (production DB)
- **Container Strategy** spans Epic 003 (microservices) and Epic 004 (deployment)

## SDD Implementation Approach

Each epic would follow the complete SDD workflow:

### **Epic Directory Structure**
```
specs/001-core-system-optimization/
├── spec.md              # Requirements and user stories
├── plan.md              # Technical architecture
├── data-model.md        # Configuration and data structures
├── contracts/           # API interfaces
├── research.md          # Technology evaluation
└── quickstart.md        # Validation scenarios
```

### **Quality Gates**
- **`/specify`** - Clear requirements for each epic component
- **`/clarify`
