# Citadel Agent-First Development Approach

**Document Purpose:** Define the agent-first development methodology that guides Citadel's architecture, implementation patterns, and operational practices at component (L3) and code (L4) levels.

**Scope:** Technical development approach, architectural patterns, and implementation guidelines for Citadel V2 development.

## 1. Development Philosophy & Approach

### **Agent-First Paradigm**
Citadel adopts an agent-first development approach where capabilities are systematically exposed as typed tools built on top of Pydantic-AI agents. This architectural decision enables sophisticated interaction patterns while maintaining clean separation of concerns and testability.

**Core Interaction Patterns:**
- **Agent-to-Agent Collaboration:** Orchestrated pipelines with tool chaining capabilities for complex workflows
- **Human-to-Agent Interaction:** Natural language interfaces through AG-UI event streaming and Open Web-UI conversational interfaces
- **System Integration:** Event-driven architecture with progress tracking and provenance management

**Benefits of Agent-First Design:**
- **Natural Language Interfaces:** Business actions expressed as intents rather than technical commands
- **Composable Architecture:** Tools can be combined and orchestrated for complex workflows
- **Testability:** Clear interfaces and dependency injection enable comprehensive testing strategies
- **Extensibility:** New capabilities can be added as tools without modifying existing agents

### **SOLID Design Principles**
The agent-first approach is grounded in SOLID object-oriented design principles that ensure maintainable, extensible, and testable code.

**Principle Application:**
- **Single Responsibility:** Each tool performs one specific function (crawl, chunk, embed, store)
- **Open/Closed:** New tools (e.g., PDF ingestion) can be added without modifying existing agents
- **Liskov Substitution:** Interface implementations can be swapped (Qdrant â†’ mock) without breaking callers
- **Interface Segregation:** Separate interfaces (ICrawler, IEmbedder, IVectorStore) prevent fat client dependencies
- **Dependency Inversion:** Agents depend on interfaces with implementations injected at runtime

## 2. Architectural Principles & Guidelines

### **Event-Driven Architecture**
Citadel implements a comprehensive event-driven architecture that decouples components and enables real-time user experience.

**Event Categories:**
- **Acquisition Events:** AcquisitionStarted, AcquisitionProgress, AcquisitionCompleted, AcquisitionError
- **Query Events:** QueryIssued, QueryResponse with provenance and confidence metadata
- **System Events:** CollectionCreated, CollectionUpdated, DocumentFetched, ChunkEmbedded

**Event Benefits:**
- **Reduced Coupling:** UI and systems react to events rather than direct API calls
- **Real-Time Updates:** Progress indicators and status updates stream to users
- **Audit Trail:** Complete event history provides comprehensive system observability
- **Scalability:** Event-driven patterns support horizontal scaling and load distribution

### **Contract-Based Integration**
All system interactions are governed by explicit contracts that ensure compatibility and enable independent component evolution.

**Contract Types:**
- **Data Contracts:** Pydantic models for AcquisitionJob, Chunk, Provenance, Query, Answer
- **API Contracts:** REST/gRPC interfaces with OpenAPI specifications
- **Event Contracts:** Versioned event schemas with backward compatibility guarantees
- **Security Contracts:** Every interaction carries tenant_id, roles, scopes, and collection context

### **Security-by-Design Framework**
Security considerations are integrated into every architectural decision and implementation pattern.

**Security Integration Points:**
- **Identity Management:** Clerk-backed authentication with SSO, MFA, and RBAC
- **Token Management:** Tenant-scoped JWT tokens with time-based expiration
- **Collection Security:** Fine-grained permissions with audit trail
- **Data Protection:** Encryption at rest and in transit with PII redaction capabilities

## 3. Component Architecture (L3)

### **System Component Overview**
The L3 architecture defines clear component boundaries and responsibilities within the distributed system.

### **Component Responsibilities**
Each component has clearly defined responsibilities that support the overall system architecture.

**Client Layer Components:**
- **Open Web-UI:** Provides conversational retrieval interfaces, system dashboards, and collection management capabilities
- **AG-UI Event Bus:** Streams real-time events (progress, results, errors) between backend services and user interfaces
- **Clerk Authentication:** Manages authentication and authorization with SSO, MFA, and RBAC capabilities
- **LiveKit RTC:** Enables optional real-time communication for voice, video, and data collaboration

**Orchestration Layer Components:**
- **hx-orchestrator-server:** Central hub hosting agents, scheduling jobs, and enforcing policy and tenancy controls
- **Agents (Acquisition & RAG):** Domain-specific agents that encapsulate business logic for ingestion, chunking, embedding, retrieval, and answer generation
- **Crawl4AI:** Specialized framework for fetching and normalizing content at scale with parallel processing capabilities
- **Copilotkit:** Agent orchestration framework for complex multi-step workflows

**Data & Model Layer Components:**
- **Qdrant:** Production vector database providing scalable vector storage with metadata filtering and search capabilities
- **PostgreSQL:** Relational database managing metadata, job tracking, provenance records, and audit logs
- **Redis:** In-memory data store supporting queues, rate limiting, and ephemeral caching
- **LiteLLM Router:** Unified interface for multiple LLM providers with load balancing and failover
- **LLM Hosts (hx-llm01/02):** Dedicated inference servers providing gpt-oss:20b and phi3:3.8b model access
- **Embeddings Service:** Specialized service providing text-to-vector conversion using nomic-embed-text and all-MiniLM-L6-v2 models

## 4. Implementation Patterns (L4)

### **Class Design & Interface Architecture**
The L4 design implements clean interfaces and dependency injection patterns that support testing and extensibility.

    class AgentOrchestrator {
        +runIntent(Intent): Result
        +emit(Event)
        -eventBus: IEventBus
    }
    class AcquisitionAgent {
        +ingest(IngestionParams): JobId
        -tools: List~IAcquisitionTool~
        -repo: IVectorStore
        -crawler: ICrawler

        +publish(Event)
        +subscribe(Topic)
    }
    class ILLM {
        <<interface>>
        +complete(Prompt): Stream
    }

    RAGAgent --> ILLM
```

### **Implementation Template Patterns**
Core implementation patterns demonstrate how SOLID principles are applied in practice.

**Interface Definition Pattern:**
```python
class IVectorStore(Protocol):
    """Vector storage interface supporting upsert and search operations."""
    def upsert(self, chunks: list[Chunk]) -> None:
        """Store vector chunks with metadata."""
        ...
    
    def search(self, embedding: Vector, filter_params: dict) -> list[Hit]:
        """Perform similarity search with metadata filtering."""
        ...
```

**Agent Implementation Pattern:**
```python
class AcquisitionAgent:
    """Agent responsible for data acquisition workflows."""
    
    def __init__(self, 
                 crawler: ICrawler, 
                 embedder: IEmbedder, 
                 store: IVectorStore, 
                 events: IEventBus):
        self.crawler = crawler
        self.embedder = embedder
        self.store = store
        self.events = events
    
    async def ingest(self, params: IngestionParams) -> str:
        """Execute complete data acquisition workflow."""
        job_id = generate_job_id()
        
        # Emit start event
        self.events.publish(AcquisitionStarted(job_id, params))
        
        try:
            # Fetch content
            pages = await self.crawler.fetch(
                [params.url], 
                depth=params.depth, 
                mode=params.mode
            )
            
            # Process content
            chunks = chunker.by_headers(pages)
            vectors = await self.embedder.embed([c.text for c in chunks])
            
            # Store results
            self.store.upsert(attach_metadata(chunks, vectors, params.collection))
            
            # Emit completion event
            stats = calculate_stats(pages, chunks)
            self.events.publish(AcquisitionCompleted(job_id, stats))
            
            return job_id
            
        except Exception as e:
            self.events.publish(AcquisitionError(job_id, str(e)))
            raise
```

### **Dependency Injection & Testing**
The architecture supports comprehensive testing through dependency injection and interface-based design.

**Test Implementation Pattern:**
```python
class TestAcquisitionAgent:
    """Test suite demonstrating dependency injection for testing."""
    
    def setup_method(self):
        """Setup test dependencies with mocks."""
        self.mock_crawler = Mock(spec=ICrawler)
        self.mock_embedder = Mock(spec=IEmbedder)
        self.mock_store = Mock(spec=IVectorStore)
        self.mock_events = Mock(spec=IEventBus)
        
        self.agent = AcquisitionAgent(
            self.mock_crawler,
            self.mock_embedder,
            self.mock_store,
            self.mock_events
        )
    
    async def test_successful_ingestion(self):
        """Test complete ingestion workflow."""
        # Setup mock responses
        self.mock_crawler.fetch.return_value = [mock_page]
        self.mock_embedder.embed.return_value = [mock_vector]
        
        # Execute
        job_id = await self.agent.ingest(mock_params)
        
        # Verify interactions
        self.mock_events.publish.assert_any_call(
            AcquisitionStarted(job_id, mock_params)
        )
        self.mock_store.upsert.assert_called_once()
        self.mock_events.publish.assert_any_call(
            AcquisitionCompleted(job_id, mock_stats)
        )
```
