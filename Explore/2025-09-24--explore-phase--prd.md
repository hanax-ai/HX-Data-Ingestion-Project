# PRD: Explore Phase - "To-Be" Solution Design

**Feature Name:** Explore Phase Planning & Design  
**Status:** Planning  
**Owner:** Project Management  
**Date:** 2025-09-24

## 1. Introduction/Overview

With the successful completion of the Discovery Phase, we have a comprehensive "as-is" understanding of the prototype and its surrounding methodology. This initial phase also highlighted key architectural and operational gaps that must be addressed. This PRD outlines the scope, activities, and deliverables for the Explore Phase, which officially begins now. The mission of this phase is to transform the "as-is" findings into a validated "to-be" solution design, ensuring full readiness for the subsequent Realize (implementation) Phase.

## 2. Goals

**Define "To-Be" State:** Produce a complete set of validated business process designs, data flow diagrams, and functional specifications for the V2 system.

**Finalize Architecture:** Define and get stakeholder approval on the definitive solution architecture, including integrations, security, and infrastructure.

**Create Actionable Backlog:** Build a detailed and prioritized product backlog that is ready for the engineering team to begin work on in the first sprint of the Realize Phase.

**Establish QA Framework:** Create a comprehensive test strategy and detailed test plans to ensure quality throughout the implementation phase.

**Update Project Plan:** Revise the overall project plan and schedule to reflect the detailed scope discovered during this phase.

## 3. User Stories

**As an Engineer,** I want a confirmed solution architecture and a detailed, prioritized backlog so that I can begin implementation in the Realize phase with clear requirements and minimal ambiguity.

**As a Project Manager,** I want an updated and validated project plan and schedule so that I can accurately track progress, manage resources, and communicate timelines to stakeholders.

**As a QA Lead,** I want a comprehensive test strategy and specific test plans so that I can prepare the necessary resources and environments for quality assurance activities in the Realize phase.

## 4. Functional Requirements

**FR-001:** The project team MUST define and document the end-to-end "to-be" functional process and data flows for all primary use case scenarios identified in the Discovery phase.

**FR-002:** The project team MUST produce a detailed Product Backlog containing epics, user stories, and tasks derived from the consolidated audit report and "to-be" design.

**FR-003:** The project team MUST define, document, and validate the complete V2 solution architecture, covering system integrations, API interfaces, security controls, and data migration strategies.

**FR-004:** The project team MUST create a comprehensive Test Strategy and a set of detailed Test Plans for the Realize Phase. These plans must define testing methodologies for data migration, integrations, and custom developments.

**FR-005:** The project team MUST update the overall Project Plan and Schedule, incorporating the detailed scope, timeline, and resource requirements defined in this phase.

**FR-006:** All architectural decisions MUST be documented using the established ADR (Architecture Decision Record) format within the knowledge base.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- This phase will not include the writing of any feature-level production code.
- This phase will not include the execution of the test plans (which is a Realize Phase activity).
- This phase will not involve deploying or provisioning new infrastructure; it will only confirm the infrastructure design and requirements.

## 6. Design Considerations

- All process and data flow diagrams are to be created using Mermaid to ensure consistency and maintainability within our Markdown-based documentation system.
- The Solution Architecture Document should be structured to be clear and accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## 7. Technical Considerations

- The final selection of the production vector database (e.g., Qdrant vs. ChromaDB) must be made and documented in the Solution Architecture Document.
- The dependency optimization strategy (e.g., using optional dependency groups) must be finalized.

## 8. Success Metrics

- 100% of the Key Deliverables for this phase are completed and have received formal sign-off from the relevant stakeholders (e.g., Engineering Lead, Product Owner).
- The Product Backlog is sufficiently detailed to populate the first two sprints of the Realize Phase with "Ready" status stories.
- The updated Project Plan has an agreed-upon timeline and resource allocation that is approved by project leadership.
