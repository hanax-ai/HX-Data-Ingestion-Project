# PRD: Citadel Demo - Explore Phase

**Product Name:** Citadel  
**Phase:** Explore (Demo Development)  
**Status:** Planning  
**Owner:** Project Management  
**Date:** 2025-09-24

## 1. Introduction/Overview

We have successfully completed the Discovery Phase with a comprehensive "as-is" understanding of our prototype. Now we transition to the **Explore Phase**, where we evolve the prototype into **Citadel** - a named product with demo capabilities that we can socialize with stakeholders, gather feedback, and refine our approach.

**This is NOT a production-ready system.** Citadel is a demo designed to validate our approach, demonstrate capabilities, and collect user feedback to inform future development decisions.

## 2. Goals

**Create Citadel Demo:** Transform the prototype into a polished, named demo application that showcases core data ingestion and RAG capabilities.

**Enable Socialization:** Build a demo that can be easily shared with stakeholders, potential users, and decision-makers to gather meaningful feedback.

**Validate Approach:** Use the demo to test our technical approach and user experience assumptions in a controlled environment.

**Gather Feedback:** Create mechanisms to collect structured feedback on functionality, usability, and value proposition.

**Refine Vision:** Use demo feedback to inform and refine our understanding of what the eventual production system should become.

## 3. User Stories

**As a Stakeholder,** I want to see a working demo of Citadel so that I can understand the value proposition and provide informed feedback on the direction.

**As a Potential User,** I want to interact with Citadel's core features so that I can evaluate whether this approach meets my data ingestion and RAG needs.

**As a Product Manager,** I want structured feedback from demo sessions so that I can prioritize features and improvements for future iterations.

**As a Developer,** I want a stable demo environment so that I can showcase our technical capabilities and gather technical feedback.

## 4. Functional Requirements

**FR-001:** Citadel MUST have a clear product identity with consistent naming, branding, and messaging throughout the demo experience.

**FR-002:** Citadel MUST demonstrate end-to-end data ingestion workflow from web crawling through RAG query responses in a polished, user-friendly interface.

**FR-003:** Citadel MUST include demo-appropriate data sets and use cases that showcase capabilities without requiring complex setup from users.

**FR-004:** Citadel MUST have built-in feedback collection mechanisms to gather structured input from demo users and stakeholders.

**FR-005:** Citadel MUST be easily deployable for demo purposes, with simple setup instructions and minimal external dependencies.

**FR-006:** Citadel MUST address the most critical issues identified in Discovery phase that would prevent effective demonstration (network timeouts, error handling, basic logging).

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Production-grade security, authentication, or authorization systems
- Horizontal scaling or distributed architecture
- Production monitoring, alerting, or operational tooling
- Enterprise integration capabilities
- Performance optimization beyond demo requirements
- Comprehensive test suites or CI/CD pipelines

## 6. Demo-Specific Requirements

**Branding & Identity:**
- Consistent "Citadel" naming throughout the application
- Simple, clean user interface that focuses on core functionality
- Clear value proposition messaging for stakeholders

**Demo Data & Scenarios:**
- Pre-configured demo datasets that showcase different use cases
- Sample crawling targets that demonstrate various content types
- Example queries that highlight RAG capabilities

**Feedback Collection:**
- Built-in feedback forms or mechanisms
- Usage analytics to understand how demo users interact with features
- Structured feedback collection for stakeholder sessions

**Deployment Simplicity:**
- Single-command demo deployment
- Minimal external dependencies
- Clear setup documentation for demo environments

## 7. Technical Considerations

**Critical Fixes Only:** Address only the issues that would prevent successful demonstration:
- Network timeout/retry for reliable crawling demos
- Basic error handling to prevent demo crashes
- Simple logging for demo troubleshooting

**Demo-Appropriate Architecture:** 
- Keep the current single-process design for simplicity
- Use ChromaDB for demo purposes (no production database needed)
- Maintain current dependency structure unless it prevents demo functionality

**User Experience Focus:**
- Streamlit interface improvements for better demo experience
- Clear progress indicators during crawling operations
- Intuitive navigation and feature discovery

## 8. Success Metrics

**Demo Readiness:**
- Citadel can be deployed and demonstrated without technical issues
- All core workflows (crawl → ingest → query) work reliably in demo environment
- Demo can be completed in 15-20 minutes with meaningful results

**Feedback Collection:**
- Structured feedback collected from at least 5 stakeholder demo sessions
- User interaction data captured to understand feature usage patterns
- Clear themes identified from feedback for future development priorities

**Stakeholder Engagement:**
- Positive reception of Citadel concept and approach
- Clear understanding of value proposition among stakeholders
- Actionable feedback received for next development phase

## 9. Deliverables

**DEL-001:** Citadel Demo Application
- Rebranded prototype with consistent "Citadel" identity
- Polished Streamlit interface optimized for demonstration
- Pre-configured demo scenarios and datasets

**DEL-002:** Demo Deployment Package
- Simple deployment instructions and scripts
- Demo environment configuration
- Troubleshooting guide for demo setup

**DEL-003:** Feedback Collection System
- Built-in feedback mechanisms within Citadel
- Stakeholder feedback templates and processes
- Analytics dashboard for demo usage insights

**DEL-004:** Demo Presentation Materials
- Stakeholder presentation deck explaining Citadel vision
- Demo script and talking points
- FAQ document addressing common questions

**DEL-005:** Critical Issue Fixes
- Network resilience improvements for reliable demos
- Basic error handling to prevent demo interruptions
- Simple logging for demo troubleshooting

**Remember:** Citadel is a demo, not a production system. Our goal is to socialize, gather feedback, and refine our approach - not to build production-ready software.
