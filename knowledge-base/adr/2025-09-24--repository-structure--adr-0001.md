# ADR-0001: Adopt Knowledge-Base Structure with Standardized Naming

## Context

The HX Data Ingestion Project needed a scalable, organized approach to documentation management that would support:

- **Growing documentation volume** as the project develops through SDD phases
- **Multiple document types** (overviews, guides, analyses, updates, decisions)
- **Team collaboration** with clear ownership and status tracking
- **Discoverability** through consistent naming and organization
- **Integration with Spec-Driven Development** methodology and workflows

The existing flat structure with ad-hoc naming was becoming difficult to navigate and maintain, particularly as we prepared to implement the enhanced SDD workflow with `/clarify` and `/analyze` commands.

## Decision

We will implement a **knowledge-base directory structure** with **standardized file naming convention**:

### Directory Structure
```
knowledge-base/
â”œâ”€â”€ overview/         # High-level understanding documents
â”œâ”€â”€ guides/           # How-to guides and operational procedures
â”œâ”€â”€ analyses/         # Deep dives, research, and analytical documents
â”œâ”€â”€ updates/          # Changelogs, release notes, status updates
â””â”€â”€ adr/              # Architecture Decision Records
```

### File Naming Convention
Format: `YYYY-MM-DD--scope--doc-type.md`

- **YYYY-MM-DD**: ISO date format for chronological sorting
- **scope**: Short kebab-case topic identifier
- **doc-type**: Document category (overview, guide, analysis, update, adr-####)

### Enhanced Front Matter
All documents include YAML front matter with SDD-specific enhancements:
```yaml
---
title: Human-readable title
owner: @username
status: Draft | In Review | Approved | Deprecated
tags: [relevant, tags]
summary: One-sentence purpose statement
sdd_phase: specify | clarify | plan | tasks | analyze | implement | general
related_specs: [list of related feature specs]
constitutional_impact: none | low | medium | high
---
```

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes

**Improved Organization**: Clear categorization makes documents easier to find and understand in context.

**Chronological Tracking**: Date-prefixed filenames provide natural timeline organization and sorting.

**Enhanced Metadata**: Front matter enables better document lifecycle management and cross-referencing.

**SDD Integration**: Structure supports Spec-Driven Development workflow with proper traceability.

**Scalability**: Pattern works for small teams and scales to larger organizations.

**Grep-Friendly**: Standardized naming enables powerful search and filtering capabilities.

### Potential Challenges

**Learning Curve**: Team members need to adopt new naming conventions and front matter requirements.

**Maintenance Overhead**: Keeping metadata current requires discipline and potentially automation.

**Migration Effort**: Existing documents require restructuring and front matter addition.

### Mitigation Strategies

**Clear Documentation**: Comprehensive templates and examples reduce adoption friction.

**Gradual Implementation**: Phased approach allows team to adapt incrementally.

**Automation Opportunities**: Future pre-commit hooks and validation tools can reduce manual overhead.

## Alternatives Considered

### Flat Structure with Prefixes
**Rejected**: Would not scale well and lacks semantic organization.

### Wiki-Style Organization
**Rejected**: Less integration with Git workflow and SDD methodology.

### Tool-Specific Solutions (Notion, Confluence)
**Rejected**: Reduces integration with code repository and SDD tools.

### Minimal Structure
**Rejected**: Insufficient for project complexity and growth trajectory.

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Structure (Completed)
- âœ… Created knowledge-base directory structure
- âœ… Migrated existing documents with proper naming
- âœ… Added enhanced front matter to all documents
- âœ… Created templates and documentation

### Phase 2: Process Integration (Next)
- ðŸ”„ Update README files with knowledge-base links
- ðŸ”„ Create CHANGELOG.md for updates tracking
- ðŸ”„ Establish PR templates with documentation checklist

### Phase 3: Automation (Future)
- ðŸ“‹ Pre-commit hooks for filename validation
- ðŸ“‹ Front matter completeness checking
- ðŸ“‹ Cross-reference validation tools

## Related Decisions

This decision supports and is supported by:
- **SDD Methodology Adoption**: Provides structure for SDD documentation needs
- **Enhanced Workflow Implementation**: Supports `/clarify` and `/analyze` command outputs
- **Team Collaboration Standards**: Establishes clear ownership and review processes

**Status**: Approved and implemented as of 2025-09-24
**Next Review**: After 30 days of usage to assess effectiveness and identify improvements
