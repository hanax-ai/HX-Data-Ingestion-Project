# HX Data Ingestion Project Overview

## Project Purpose

The HX Data Ingestion Project is designed to build a robust, scalable data ingestion system using **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** methodology. The project emphasizes systematic requirements definition, iterative refinement, and AI-powered implementation to deliver high-quality data processing workflows.

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **Specification Phase** - Currently in the initial setup and requirements gathering phase using the enhanced SDD workflow.

### Completed Milestones
- âœ… **Repository Setup**: Clean GitHub repository with organized structure
- âœ… **SDD Integration**: Complete Spec Kit templates and enhanced workflow
- âœ… **Knowledge Base**: Organized documentation with standardized naming
- âœ… **Standards Implementation**: File naming conventions and metadata standards

### Next Steps
- ðŸ”„ **Project Constitution**: Establish governing principles using `/constitution`
- ðŸ“‹ **Requirements Definition**: Define data ingestion needs using `/specify`
- ðŸ“‹ **Clarification Process**: Resolve ambiguities using `/clarify`
- ðŸ“‹ **Technical Planning**: Create implementation plan using `/plan`

## Methodology Approach

### Spec-Driven Development
The project follows the enhanced SDD workflow with 7 key phases:

1. **`/constitution`** - Establish non-negotiable project principles
2. **`/specify`** - Define requirements and user stories (WHAT and WHY)
3. **`/clarify`** - Resolve ambiguities through interactive questioning
4. **`/plan`** - Create technical implementation plan (HOW)
5. **`/tasks`** - Break down into actionable tasks
6. **`/analyze`** - Validate consistency and constitutional compliance
7. **`/implement`** - Execute the implementation

### Key Principles
- **Intent-Driven Development**: Focus on WHAT and WHY before HOW
- **Executable Specifications**: Specs generate working implementations
- **Continuous Refinement**: AI-powered validation and iteration
- **Constitutional Compliance**: All development aligns with project principles

## Technology Stack

### Development Environment
- **AI Coding Agent**: Cursor (primary development agent)
- **Version Control**: GitHub with structured branching
- **Package Management**: uv for Python dependencies
- **Cross-Platform**: Support for Linux, macOS, and Windows

### Available Resources
- **Environment Variables**: `HX_DIP_VAR` and `HX_DIP_SECRET` for project-specific configuration
- **Spec Kit Integration**: Complete templates and automation scripts
- **Enhanced Workflow**: Latest `/clarify` and `/analyze` commands

## Data Ingestion Scope

*To be defined through the `/specify` process*

The specific scope, data sources, transformation requirements, and architectural approach will be systematically defined through the SDD workflow. This ensures comprehensive requirements gathering and reduces implementation risk.

### Anticipated Areas
- **Data Source Integration**: Various input formats and systems
- **Transformation Pipelines**: Data processing and enrichment workflows
- **Quality Assurance**: Validation and error handling mechanisms
- **Scalability**: Performance and volume handling capabilities
- **Monitoring**: Observability and operational insights

## Team Collaboration

### Ownership Model
- **Project Owner**: @jarvisr
- **Development Approach**: Collaborative SDD with AI agent assistance
- **Documentation Standards**: Enhanced front matter with SDD integration
- **Decision Tracking**: Formal ADR process for architectural choices

### Workflow Integration
- **Feature Development**: Branch-based with spec-first approach
- **Quality Gates**: Built-in validation through `/analyze` command
- **Continuous Documentation**: Living specifications that evolve with implementation
- **Cross-Reference Tracking**: Maintained links between requirements and implementation

## Success Criteria

### Technical Objectives
- **Robust Data Processing**: Reliable ingestion and transformation capabilities
- **Scalable Architecture**: Performance at anticipated data volumes
- **Maintainable Codebase**: Clear structure with comprehensive documentation
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing and validation

### Process Objectives
- **Methodology Validation**: Successful application of enhanced SDD workflow
- **Documentation Excellence**: Complete, current, and useful project documentation
- **Team Efficiency**: Streamlined development process with reduced rework
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Clear understanding and reproducible processes

## Risk Mitigation

### SDD Methodology
- **Under-Specification Risk**: Mitigated by `/clarify` command and interactive refinement
- **Consistency Risk**: Addressed by `/analyze` command and constitutional compliance
- **Scope Creep**: Controlled through systematic specification and validation gates

### Technical Implementation
- **Complexity Management**: Phased approach with iterative validation
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in testing and validation throughout SDD workflow
- **Performance Risk**: Early architectural planning and scalability considerations
