**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - Frontend + Backend + AI Agent Services

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - âœ… Pydantic-AI agent framework patterns and best practices
   - âœ… Qdrant vector database integration and optimization
   - âœ… LiteLLM unified interface implementation
   - âœ… Open Web-UI frontend integration patterns
   - âœ… Clerk authentication integration
   - âœ… LiveKit real-time communication setup
   - âœ… AG-UI event bus architecture
   - âœ… HX Infrastructure Management deployment

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   âœ… Task: "Research Pydantic-AI agent framework for data acquisition agents"
   âœ… Task: "Find best practices for Qdrant vector database in enterprise applications"
   âœ… Task: "Research LiteLLM unified interface for multi-provider LLM support"
   âœ… Task: "Find best practices for Open Web-UI frontend integration"
   âœ… Task: "Research Clerk authentication integration patterns"
   âœ… Task: "Find best practices for LiveKit real-time communication"
   âœ… Task: "Research AG-UI event bus architecture patterns"
   âœ… Task: "Find best practices for HX Infrastructure Management deployment"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** â†’ `data-model.md`:
   - **AcquisitionJob**: job_id, collection_name, acquisition_type, parameters, status, progress, created_at, updated_at
   - **Collection**: collection_id, name, description, created_by, created_at, updated_at, metadata
   - **Document**: document_id, collection_id, source_url, content, metadata, embeddings, created_at
   - **Provenance**: provenance_id, document_id, source_url, timestamp, metadata, confidence_score
   - **User**: user_id, email, roles, permissions, created_at, last_login
   - **Event**: event_id, event_type, payload, timestamp, user_id, session_id

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - **POST /api/v1/acquisitions** - Create new data acquisition job
   - **GET /api/v1/acquisitions/{job_id}** - Get acquisition job status
   - **GET /api/v1/acquisitions/{job_id}/progress** - Get real-time progress
   - **POST /api/v1/collections** - Create new collection
   - **GET /api/v1/collections** - List user collections
   - **POST /api/v1/queries** - Execute semantic query
   - **GET /api/v1/queries/{query_id}/results** - Get query results
   - **WebSocket /ws/events** - Real-time event streaming
   - Output OpenAPI schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - **User Story 1**: Create data acquisition job â†’ integration test scenario
   - **User Story 2**: Monitor acquisition progress â†’ integration test scenario
   - **User Story 3**: Execute semantic query â†’ integration test scenario
   - **User Story 4**: Manage collections â†’ integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh citadel-v2`
   - Add new tech from current plan: Pydantic-AI, Qdrant, LiteLLM, Open Web-UI, Clerk, LiveKit, AG-UI
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract â†’ contract test task [P]
- Each entity â†’ model creation task [P] 
- Each user story â†’ integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Infrastructure order: Database setup before application deployment
- Agent order: Core agents before specialized agents
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Distributed Service Architecture | Enterprise scalability requirements | Single service insufficient for production load |
| Multiple Agent Types | Specialized data acquisition needs | Generic agent insufficient for different source types |
| Real-Time Event Streaming | User experience requirements | Polling-based updates insufficient for real-time collaboration |
| Comprehensive Security Framework | Enterprise compliance requirements | Basic authentication insufficient for enterprise deployment |

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
