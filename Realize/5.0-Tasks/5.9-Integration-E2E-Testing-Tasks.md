# Tasks: Integration & End-to-End Testing

**Input**: All specifications, Constitution v1.0, System Architecture v3.1
**Prerequisites**: All services deployed, monitoring active, production-like test environment

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load all specifications and architecture documents
   → Extract: user workflows, performance targets, security requirements
2. Generate comprehensive test suite:
   → Integration tests: service-to-service interactions
   → E2E tests: complete user journeys
   → Performance tests: load, stress, soak
   → Security tests: penetration, vulnerability
3. Apply task rules:
   → Different test categories = mark [P] for parallel
   → Tests validate constitutional requirements
5. Number tasks sequentially (T961...)
6. Return: SUCCESS (comprehensive test coverage ready)
```
