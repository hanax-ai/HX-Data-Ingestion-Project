2. Open "Active Work Items (Last 7 Days)"
3. Run query
4. Verify results displayed
5. Test other queries

**Expected:** All queries return results

### Test 4: Sprint Planning

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Work Item Creation Rate Limited
**Solution:** Script includes 700ms delay between creations

### Issue: Parent-Child Linking Fails
**Solution:** Ensure parent work item created before child

### Issue: Area Path Not Found
**Solution:** Verify area path created in step 2

### Issue: Iteration Not Found
**Solution:** Verify iteration created in step 3

### Issue: Permission Denied
**Solution:** Verify PAT has Work Items (Write) scope

---

## Rollback Procedure

### Remove All Work Items
```powershell
# Query all work items
$workItems = az boards query --wiql "SELECT [System.Id] FROM WorkItems WHERE [System.TeamProject] = 'HX-Data-Ingestion-Project'" --output json | ConvertFrom-Json

# Delete in reverse order (tasks, stories, features, epics)
foreach ($wi in $workItems) {
    az boards work-item delete --id $wi.id --yes --destroy
}
```

**⚠️ WARNING:** This is destructive and irreversible!
