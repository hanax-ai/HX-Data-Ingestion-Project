# Event System Test Cases

**Feature:** Event System & Real-Time Communication  
**Specification:** 4.9-Citadel-Event-System.md  
**Total Test Cases:** 3 (Template / Planning Document)  
**Status:** Draft - Core examples provided, full test suite pending  
**Constitutional Requirement:** Event-Driven Architecture (≤500ms latency)  

**TODO**: Populate remaining 57 test cases covering all event system scenarios

## TC-EVT-001: Progress Event Publishing

**Priority:** P0 - Critical  
**Type:** Integration Test  

#### Description
Verify progress events published to event bus with correct schema.

#### Test Steps
1. Start acquisition job
2. Monitor Kafka topic
3. Capture progress events
4. Validate event schema

#### Expected Results
- Events published to correct topic
- Schema matches CloudEvents standard
- All required fields present
- Event latency < 200ms

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Events published
- [ ] Schema valid
- [ ] Latency < 200ms

## TC-EVT-002: WebSocket Real-Time Delivery

**Priority:** P0 - Critical  
**Type:** Integration Test  

#### Description
Verify events delivered to frontend via WebSocket with ≤500ms latency.

#### Test Steps
1. Frontend connects to WebSocket
2. Subscribe to job events
3. Trigger progress event
4. Measure delivery time

#### Expected Results
- WebSocket connection stable
- Events delivered to subscribed clients
- End-to-end latency ≤500ms
- No event loss

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Events delivered
- [ ] Latency ≤500ms
- [ ] No loss

## TC-EVT-010: LiveKit Collaboration

**Priority:** P1 - High  
**Type:** E2E Test  

#### Description
Verify multi-user collaboration via LiveKit.

#### Test Steps
1. User1 starts acquisition
2. User1 creates collaboration room
3. User2 joins room
4. Both users monitor progress
5. Verify synchronized updates

#### Expected Results
- Room created
- User2 joins successfully
- Both see same progress
- Updates synchronized
- Voice communication active

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Collaboration works
- [ ] Updates synchronized
- [ ] Voice functional
