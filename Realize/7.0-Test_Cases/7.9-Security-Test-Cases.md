## TC-SEC-001: Penetration Test - Authentication Bypass

**Priority:** P0 - Critical  
**Type:** Security Test  

#### Description
Attempt to bypass authentication through various attack vectors.

#### Attack Vectors
1. Direct API access without token
2. Expired token usage
3. Token from different user
4. Malformed token
5. SQL injection in login
6. Session hijacking

#### Test Steps
1. Attempt each attack vector
2. Verify all blocked
3. Check security logging

#### Expected Results
- All bypass attempts blocked
- HTTP 401 Unauthorized returned
- Security events logged
- No unauthorized access

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All attacks blocked
- [ ] Proper error codes
- [ ] Security logged
- [ ] Zero vulnerabilities

## TC-SEC-002: Penetration Test - Authorization Bypass

**Priority:** P0 - Critical  
**Type:** Security Test  

#### Description
Attempt to access unauthorized collections and resources.

#### Attack Vectors
1. Access other user's collection
2. Modify without permission
3. Delete without ownership
4. Escalate privileges
5. Bypass RBAC checks

#### Test Steps
1. Attempt each attack vector
2. Verify all blocked
3. Check audit logging

#### Expected Results
- All attempts blocked
- HTTP 403 Forbidden returned
- Audit logs complete
- No privilege escalation

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All attacks blocked
- [ ] Permissions enforced
- [ ] Audit complete

**Priority:** P0 - Critical  
**Type:** Security Test  

#### Description
Run comprehensive vulnerability scanning on all components.

#### Tools
- Trivy (container scanning)
- Bandit (Python code scanning)
- Safety (dependency scanning)
- OWASP ZAP (web application scanning)

#### Test Steps
1. Run Trivy on all container images
2. Run Bandit on all Python code
3. Run Safety on all dependencies
4. Run OWASP ZAP on web application
5. Review and triage findings

#### Expected Results
- Zero CRITICAL vulnerabilities
- Zero HIGH vulnerabilities (unmitigated)
- All MEDIUM vulnerabilities documented
- Mitigation plans for all findings

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Zero critical
- [ ] Zero high (unmitigated)
- [ ] All documented

## TC-SEC-020: Data Encryption Validation

**Priority:** P0 - Critical  
**Type:** Security Test  

#### Description
Verify data encrypted at rest and in transit.

#### Test Steps
1. Check database encryption (PostgreSQL, Qdrant)
2. Verify TLS on all connections
3. Test secret storage (Vault)
4. Validate certificate configuration

#### Expected Results
- All data at rest encrypted (AES-256)
- All connections use TLS 1.3
- Secrets in Vault, not config files
- Valid certificates

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Encryption at rest
- [ ] TLS everywhere
- [ ] Secrets secured
