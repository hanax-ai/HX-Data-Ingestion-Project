## TC-PERF-001: Query Latency Benchmark

**Priority:** P0 - Critical  
**Type:** Performance Test  

#### Description
Verify query latency meets P95 ≤2.0 seconds constitutional requirement.

#### Test Steps
1. Prepare 1000 diverse queries
2. Execute queries sequentially
3. Measure response time for each
4. Calculate percentiles

#### Expected Results
- P50: < 1.0 second
- P95: ≤ 2.0 seconds
- P99: < 3.0 seconds
- 100% success rate

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] P95 ≤ 2.0 seconds
- [ ] Zero failures
- [ ] Consistent performance

#### Performance Metrics
- Sample size: 1000 queries
- P50: < 1.0s
- P95: ≤ 2.0s
- P99: < 3.0s

## TC-PERF-002: Event Latency Validation

**Priority:** P0 - Critical  
**Type:** Performance Test  

#### Description
Verify event delivery meets ≤500ms end-to-end latency requirement.

#### Test Steps
1. Set up event monitoring
2. Trigger 1000 progress events
3. Measure publish-to-delivery time
4. Calculate P95 latency

#### Expected Results
- P95 latency ≤ 500ms
- P99 latency < 800ms
- Average latency < 200ms
- Zero lost events

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] P95 ≤ 500ms
- [ ] No event loss
- [ ] Consistent delivery

## TC-PERF-010: Concurrent Query Throughput

**Priority:** P0 - Critical  
**Type:** Load Test  

#### Description
Verify system handles ≥200 RPS concurrent queries.

#### Test Steps
1. Configure Locust with 200 users
2. Run for 10 minutes
3. Each user: 1 query/second
4. Measure throughput and latency

#### Expected Results
- Sustained throughput ≥200 RPS
- P95 latency still ≤2.0 seconds
- Error rate < 1%
- Resource usage stable

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Throughput ≥200 RPS
- [ ] Latency maintained
- [ ] Errors < 1%

## TC-PERF-020: Soak Test (24 hours)

**Priority:** P0 - Critical  
**Type:** Soak Test  

#### Description
Verify system stability under continuous load for 24 hours.

#### Test Steps
1. Configure moderate load (50 RPS)
2. Run for 24 hours
3. Monitor memory usage
4. Check for leaks
5. Verify performance stability

#### Expected Results
- System runs 24 hours continuously
- Memory usage stable (no leaks)
- Performance consistent throughout
- No degradation over time
- Zero crashes

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 24-hour completion
- [ ] Memory stable
- [ ] Performance consistent
- [ ] Zero crashes
