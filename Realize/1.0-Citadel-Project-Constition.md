# HX Data Ingestion Project Constitution

**Governing Principles for Citadel V2 Development**

*This constitution establishes the non-negotiable principles and guidelines that govern all development decisions for the HX Data Ingestion Project.*

## Status

✅ **Active** - Governing principles established for Citadel V2 implementation phase.

## Purpose

This constitution serves as the foundational reference for all technical decisions, ensuring consistency with project values, architectural principles, and stakeholder requirements throughout the development lifecycle.

## Core Principles

### 1. Agent-First Architecture

**Principle:** All system components must be designed as intelligent agents with clear responsibilities, natural language interfaces, and autonomous decision-making capabilities.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Use Pydantic-AI framework for all agent implementations
- Implement tool-based architecture with reusable components
- Provide natural language interfaces for all user interactions
- Ensure agents have clear error handling and resilience mechanisms
- Maintain agent specialization (Single Page, Sequential Sitemap, Parallel Sitemap, Content Chunking, Recursive Exploration)

**Constitutional Mandate:** No component shall be implemented without agent-based architecture unless explicitly justified and approved by the architecture team.

### 2. Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

**Principle:** Specifications serve as the single source of truth, with executable specifications driving implementation and continuous refinement.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- All requirements must be captured in natural language specifications
- Specifications must be executable and testable
- Continuous refinement through bidirectional feedback loops
- Research-driven context integration for all decisions
- Branching for exploration with clear decision points

**Constitutional Mandate:** All development must trace back to explicit specifications. No implementation without specification.

### 3. Zero Technical Debt

**Principle:** No hardcoded values, fully idempotent operations, consistent variable organization, and comprehensive testing coverage.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- 100% dynamic configuration with no hardcoded values
- All operations must be idempotent and repeatable
- Hierarchical variable organization with clear inheritance
- >95% automated test coverage requirement
- Comprehensive documentation for all components

**Constitutional Mandate:** Technical debt is unacceptable. All code must meet production standards from first commit.

### 4. Security-by-Design

**Principle:** Security controls are integrated from the foundation, not bolted on as an afterthought.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Zero-trust network principles with micro-segmentation
- Vault-first secret management with environment-specific encryption
- Multi-factor authentication required for all user accounts
- Collection-level RBAC with audit trails
- Automated compliance validation and vulnerability assessment

**Constitutional Mandate:** Security is non-negotiable. All components must implement security controls from initial design.

### 5. Event-Driven Architecture

**Principle:** Real-time communication and provenance tracking through standardized event contracts.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- AG-UI event bus integration for all real-time communication
- Structured events carrying origin metadata and source relationships
- Real-time progress updates with ≤500ms end-to-end latency
- Complete provenance tracking for all data operations
- Standardized event contracts supporting multiple front-end applications

**Constitutional Mandate:** All user interactions must provide real-time feedback through event-driven architecture.

### 6. Production Readiness

**Principle:** All components must be production-ready from initial deployment with enterprise-grade capabilities.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Service Level Objectives: ≥99.9% availability for core APIs
- Performance targets: P95 ≤2.0 seconds for retrieval operations
- Comprehensive observability with structured logging, metrics, and tracing
- Automated failover, backup strategies, and disaster recovery
- Horizontal scaling support for all services

**Constitutional Mandate:** No prototype code in production. All components must meet enterprise standards.
