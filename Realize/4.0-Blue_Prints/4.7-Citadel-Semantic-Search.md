# Feature Specification: Citadel Semantic Search

**Feature Branch**: `citadel-semantic-search`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Vector similarity search and retrieval system with semantic matching, metadata filtering, relevance scoring, hybrid search capabilities, and cross-collection query processing"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Semantic search requirements for Citadel V2 identified
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: users, search queries, similarity matching, filtering, scoring, hybrid search
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Semantic search workflows and acceptance criteria defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a researcher**, I want to search across my knowledge collections using natural language so that I can find relevant information even when I don't know the exact terms or phrases used in the documents.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have multiple collections, **When** I search for "financial performance trends", **Then** I find relevant content across all accessible collections
2. **Given** I perform a search, **When** I review the results, **Then** I see relevance scores and can understand why each result was returned
3. **Given** I want to refine my search, **When** I apply filters, **Then** I can narrow results by collection, date range, document type, or other metadata
4. **Given** I have a complex query, **When** I search for "Q3 revenue compared to previous quarters", **Then** the system finds relevant content even if the exact phrase doesn't exist
5. **Given** I want to explore related content, **When** I click on a result, **Then** I can see similar documents and related information

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a search query returns no results?
- How does the system handle searches with very broad or very specific terms?
- What happens when search results include content the user doesn't have permission to access?
- How does the system handle searches across collections with different languages or character sets?
- What happens when the vector database is temporarily unavailable or experiencing performance issues?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST perform semantic similarity search across all accessible collections using vector embeddings
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide relevance scoring for all search results indicating match quality
- **FR-003**: System MUST support metadata filtering including collection, date range, document type, and custom fields
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement hybrid search combining semantic similarity with keyword matching
- **FR-005**: System MUST support cross-collection queries allowing users to search multiple collections simultaneously
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide search result ranking based on relevance, recency, and user preferences
- **FR-007**: System MUST support search query expansion and suggestion based on content analysis
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain search performance with sub-second response times for typical queries
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide search analytics including query patterns, result click-through rates, and performance metrics
- **FR-010**: System MUST support saved searches and search history for user convenience
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle complex queries involving multiple concepts, comparisons, and relationships [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific types of complex queries supported?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide search result export capabilities [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: export formats and content included?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST support search result caching and optimization for frequently accessed content
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide search result preview and snippet generation for quick content assessment

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Search Query**: Represents a user's search request with parameters, filters, and context
- **Search Result**: Represents a matching document chunk with relevance score, metadata, and preview
- **Relevance Score**: Represents the semantic similarity and match quality for search results
- **Search Filter**: Represents metadata constraints applied to search queries for result refinement
- **Search Analytics**: Represents usage patterns, performance metrics, and user behavior data
