# Feature Specification: Citadel Collection Management

**Feature Branch**: `citadel-collection-management`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Named collection management system with user-specified collection names and descriptions, document organization, metadata management, provenance tracking, collection-level permissions, and lifecycle management"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Collection management requirements for Citadel V2 identified
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: users, collections, documents, metadata, permissions, lifecycle
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Collection workflows and acceptance criteria defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a knowledge manager**, I want to create and organize named collections of documents so that I can group related information together and manage access permissions for my team.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am logged into Citadel, **When** I create a new collection, **Then** I can specify a name and description (e.g., "MZ-10K", "Mazda Motors 10-K reports for the past 10 years")
2. **Given** I have a collection, **When** I add documents through data acquisition, **Then** all documents are automatically associated with the collection
3. **Given** I have multiple collections, **When** I view my collection list, **Then** I see all collections with document counts, creation dates, and last updated information
4. **Given** I have a collection, **When** I set permissions, **Then** I can control which users can view, query, or modify the collection
5. **Given** I have a collection, **When** I view document details, **Then** I see complete provenance information including source URLs, acquisition timestamps, and processing metadata

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to create a collection with a name that already exists?
- How does the system handle collections that exceed storage limits?
- What happens when a user with collection access leaves the organization?
- How does the system handle collection deletion when documents are referenced in other collections?
- What happens when multiple users try to modify the same collection simultaneously?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create named collections with user-specified names and descriptions
- **FR-002**: System MUST prevent duplicate collection names within the same user's workspace
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically associate acquired documents with their designated collection
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide collection listing with document counts, creation dates, and last updated information
- **FR-005**: System MUST support collection-level permissions including view, query, and modify access
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain complete provenance tracking for all documents including source URLs, acquisition timestamps, and processing metadata
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to organize collections into folders or categories [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific organization structure and hierarchy limits?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide collection search and filtering capabilities based on name, description, content, and metadata
- **FR-009**: System MUST support collection sharing with specific users or groups [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: sharing scope and permission inheritance?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain collection version history tracking changes and modifications
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide collection export capabilities [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: export formats and content included?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST support collection archiving and restoration [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: archive retention period and restoration process?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide collection analytics including usage statistics, query patterns, and performance metrics
- **FR-014**: System MUST enforce collection-level data retention policies [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific retention periods and deletion processes?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Collection**: Represents a named group of documents with metadata, permissions, and lifecycle information
- **Document**: Represents an individual piece of content with source information, processing metadata, and collection association
- **Provenance**: Represents the complete history of a document including source, acquisition details, and processing steps
- **Collection Permission**: Represents access control rules for specific users or groups on collections
- **Collection Metadata**: Represents descriptive information about collections including creation details, usage statistics, and configuration
