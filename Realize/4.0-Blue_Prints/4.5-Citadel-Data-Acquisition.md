# Feature Specification: Citadel Data Acquisition

**Feature Branch**: `citadel-data-acquisition`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Multi-type data acquisition system with specialized agents for different source types, configurable parameters, parallel and recursive crawling, smart content chunking, and comprehensive validation with quality assurance"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Data acquisition requirements for Citadel V2 identified
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: users, acquisition types, agents, parameters, validation, quality
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Data acquisition workflows and acceptance criteria defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a data analyst**, I want to acquire data from various sources using specialized agents so that I can collect comprehensive information efficiently with appropriate quality controls.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I want to crawl a website, **When** I select "Single Page Agent", **Then** I can specify a URL and get the page content with markdown conversion
2. **Given** I have a large sitemap, **When** I select "Sequential Sitemap Agent", **Then** the system processes pages efficiently without overwhelming resources
3. **Given** I want to crawl an entire website, **When** I select "Recursive Exploration Agent", **Then** I can set depth limits and the system discovers and processes linked pages
4. **Given** I have uploaded files, **When** I select "File Processing Agent", **Then** the system processes various file formats and extracts content
5. **Given** I start an acquisition, **When** the system processes content, **Then** I see real-time validation and quality assurance checks

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a website blocks automated crawling or has rate limits?
- How does the system handle websites with dynamic content that requires JavaScript execution?
- What happens when file uploads contain corrupted or unsupported formats?
- How does the system handle very large files that exceed memory limits?
- What happens when recursive crawling encounters infinite loops or circular references?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide specialized agents for different acquisition types including Single Page, Sequential Sitemap, Parallel Sitemap, Content Chunking, and Recursive Exploration
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically select the appropriate agent based on source type and user parameters
- **FR-003**: System MUST support configurable parameters including chunk size control, batch size optimization, and search depth configuration
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement parallel processing capabilities for high-throughput data acquisition
- **FR-005**: System MUST support recursive site crawling with configurable depth limits (1-6 layers)
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide smart content chunking based on document structure and semantic boundaries
- **FR-007**: System MUST implement comprehensive validation and quality assurance throughout the acquisition process
- **FR-008**: System MUST support multiple file formats including websites, plain text, Markdown, XML sitemaps, and uploaded files
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide end-to-end pipeline visibility for accuracy and performance validation
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle acquisition failures gracefully with retry mechanisms and error reporting
- **FR-011**: System MUST support acquisition scheduling and automated refresh mechanisms [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific scheduling options and refresh frequencies?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide acquisition templates and presets for common use cases [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific template types and customization options?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain acquisition history and allow users to review past acquisition runs
- **FR-014**: System MUST support acquisition pause, resume, and cancellation capabilities [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific pause/resume behavior and state preservation?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Acquisition Agent**: Represents a specialized processing component for specific data source types
- **Acquisition Job**: Represents an active data acquisition task with configuration, status, and progress
- **Source Document**: Represents raw content acquired from external sources with metadata and processing state
- **Content Chunk**: Represents processed content segments optimized for vector search and retrieval
- **Validation Result**: Represents quality assurance outcomes with success/failure status and detailed feedback
