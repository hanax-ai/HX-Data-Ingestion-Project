# Feature Specification: Citadel Monitoring

**Feature Branch**: `citadel-monitoring`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Comprehensive observability and performance monitoring system with structured logging, metrics collection, distributed tracing, SLO monitoring, automated alerting, and operational dashboards"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Monitoring requirements for Citadel V2 identified
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: users, monitoring, observability, logging, metrics, tracing, alerting, dashboards
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Monitoring workflows and acceptance criteria defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a system administrator**, I want comprehensive monitoring and observability so that I can ensure system health, performance, and reliability while quickly identifying and resolving issues.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am monitoring system performance, **When** I view the dashboard, **Then** I see real-time metrics for all critical system components
2. **Given** a system issue occurs, **When** I investigate, **Then** I can trace the problem through distributed tracing and detailed logs
3. **Given** system performance degrades, **When** thresholds are exceeded, **Then** I receive automated alerts with detailed context
4. **Given** I need to analyze system behavior, **When** I query the monitoring data, **Then** I can access historical trends and patterns
5. **Given** I am troubleshooting an issue, **When** I examine the logs, **Then** I see structured, searchable information with correlation IDs

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the monitoring system itself experiences failures or high load?
- How does the system handle monitoring data when storage becomes full or reaches limits?
- What happens when monitoring alerts are sent but no one is available to respond?
- How does the system handle monitoring data for users who don't have permission to see certain metrics?
- What happens when monitoring data becomes corrupted or inconsistent?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide structured logging with correlation IDs for all system activities and user actions
- **FR-002**: System MUST collect comprehensive metrics including performance, usage, and business KPIs
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement distributed tracing for end-to-end request tracking across all services
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide SLO monitoring with burn rate alerting for service level objectives
- **FR-005**: System MUST support automated alerting with configurable thresholds and notification channels
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide operational dashboards with real-time metrics and historical trends
- **FR-007**: System MUST support log aggregation, search, and analysis across all system components
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide performance monitoring including response times, throughput, and resource utilization
- **FR-009**: System MUST support health checks and service discovery for all system components
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide monitoring data retention and archival policies [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific retention periods and archival processes?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST support monitoring data export and integration with external monitoring tools [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific export formats and integration protocols?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide monitoring system scalability and high availability for enterprise deployment
- **FR-013**: System MUST support custom metrics and business-specific monitoring requirements
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide monitoring analytics including usage patterns, performance trends, and capacity planning

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Log Entry**: Represents a structured log record with timestamp, level, message, and metadata
- **Metric**: Represents a measurable system or business value with timestamp and context
- **Trace**: Represents a distributed request flow with timing and dependency information
- **Alert**: Represents a notification triggered by threshold violations or system events
- **Dashboard**: Represents a visual display of metrics, logs, and system status information
