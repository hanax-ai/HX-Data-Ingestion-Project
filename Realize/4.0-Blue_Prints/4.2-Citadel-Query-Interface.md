# Feature Specification: Citadel Query Interface

**Feature Branch**: `citadel-query-interface`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Natural language query interface with semantic search, context-aware interactions, multi-turn dialogue capabilities, response generation with source attribution, confidence scoring, and intelligent query suggestions"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Query interface requirements for Citadel V2 identified
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: users, query interactions, search capabilities, response generation, conversation flow
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Query workflows and acceptance criteria defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a business analyst**, I want to ask natural language questions about my data collections so that I can quickly find relevant information and get comprehensive answers with source attribution.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have access to a collection, **When** I type "What are the main topics discussed in the Q3 financial reports?", **Then** I receive a comprehensive answer with relevant excerpts and source references
2. **Given** I am in a conversation, **When** I ask a follow-up question "Can you elaborate on the revenue projections?", **Then** the system maintains context from our previous conversation
3. **Given** I submit a query, **When** the system processes it, **Then** I see a confidence score indicating the reliability of the response
4. **Given** I start typing a query, **When** I pause, **Then** I see intelligent suggestions based on my collection content
5. **Given** I receive a response, **When** I review the sources, **Then** I can click on any source reference to view the original document

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a query returns no relevant results?
- How does the system handle ambiguous queries that could match multiple collections?
- What happens when the confidence score is very low?
- How does the system handle queries about information that doesn't exist in the collections?
- What happens when a user asks questions about data they don't have permission to access?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept natural language queries in plain English without requiring specific syntax or commands
- **FR-002**: System MUST perform semantic search across all accessible collections to find relevant content
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate comprehensive answers that synthesize information from multiple sources
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide complete source attribution including document titles, URLs, timestamps, and page references
- **FR-005**: System MUST display confidence scores indicating the reliability and completeness of each response
- **FR-006**: System MUST support multi-turn conversations with context memory across multiple queries
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide intelligent query suggestions based on collection content and user history
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to refine queries through follow-up questions and clarifications
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle queries across multiple collections simultaneously when relevant
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide query history and allow users to revisit previous questions and answers
- **FR-011**: System MUST support voice input for query submission [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific voice recognition capabilities and languages?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide query result export capabilities [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: export formats and content included?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle complex queries involving comparisons, analysis, and synthesis [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific types of complex queries supported?]
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide query performance metrics including response time and result relevance [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific metrics and reporting format?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Query**: Represents a user's natural language question with context, parameters, and processing state
- **Response**: Represents the generated answer with content, sources, confidence score, and metadata
- **Conversation**: Represents a multi-turn dialogue session with context memory and conversation history
- **Query Suggestion**: Represents intelligent recommendations based on content analysis and user patterns
- **Source Reference**: Represents attribution information linking responses back to original documents
