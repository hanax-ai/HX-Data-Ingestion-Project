# Feature Specification: Citadel Event System

**Feature Branch**: `citadel-event-system`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Real-time event streaming system with AG-UI integration, structured events, provenance tracking, real-time UI updates, collaborative features, and standardized event contracts"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Event system requirements for Citadel V2 identified
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: users, events, streaming, real-time, collaboration, contracts, provenance
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Event system workflows and acceptance criteria defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a collaborative user**, I want to receive real-time updates about system activities so that I can stay informed about progress, changes, and collaborate effectively with my team.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am monitoring an acquisition job, **When** progress updates occur, **Then** I receive real-time notifications with detailed status information
2. **Given** I am collaborating with team members, **When** someone makes changes, **Then** all team members see synchronized updates immediately
3. **Given** I perform any system action, **When** the action completes, **Then** I receive confirmation with complete provenance information
4. **Given** I am using the system, **When** important events occur, **Then** I receive appropriate notifications based on my preferences and role
5. **Given** I want to track system activities, **When** I view the event log, **Then** I see a complete history of events with timestamps and details

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the event system experiences high load or becomes overwhelmed?
- How does the system handle users who are temporarily disconnected from real-time updates?
- What happens when event delivery fails or events are lost?
- How does the system handle events for users who don't have permission to see certain information?
- What happens when the event system needs to be restarted or maintained?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide real-time event streaming with ‚â§500ms end-to-end latency for critical updates
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement structured events carrying origin metadata and source relationships
- **FR-003**: System MUST support AG-UI event bus integration for standardized event processing
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide complete provenance tracking for all system activities and data operations
- **FR-005**: System MUST support real-time UI updates for progress monitoring, status changes, and collaborative features
- **FR-006**: System MUST implement standardized event contracts supporting multiple front-end applications
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide event filtering and routing based on user permissions and preferences
- **FR-008**: System MUST support event persistence and replay capabilities for audit and recovery purposes
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide event analytics including delivery rates, latency metrics, and usage patterns
- **FR-010**: System MUST support event batching and optimization for high-volume scenarios
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide event subscription management allowing users to control notification preferences [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific subscription types and control options?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST support event encryption and security for sensitive information transmission
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide event system monitoring and health checks for operational reliability
- **FR-014**: System MUST support event system scaling and load balancing for enterprise deployment

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Event**: Represents a system occurrence with type, payload, timestamp, and metadata
- **Event Stream**: Represents a continuous flow of related events for real-time processing
- **Event Subscription**: Represents a user's interest in specific event types with filtering criteria
- **Provenance Event**: Represents tracking information linking events to their sources and relationships
- **Event Contract**: Represents standardized event structure and schema for interoperability
