# Feature Specification: Citadel Authentication

**Feature Branch**: `citadel-authentication`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Enterprise authentication and authorization system with multi-factor authentication, role-based access control, collection-level permissions, audit logging, and compliance features"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Authentication requirements for Citadel V2 identified
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: users, authentication, authorization, roles, permissions, audit, compliance
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Authentication workflows and acceptance criteria defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a system administrator**, I want to manage user access and permissions so that I can ensure data security and compliance while enabling appropriate access for different user roles.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a new user, **When** I register for an account, **Then** I must complete multi-factor authentication setup
2. **Given** I am logging in, **When** I enter my credentials, **Then** I must complete MFA verification to access the system
3. **Given** I am an administrator, **When** I assign roles to users, **Then** users receive appropriate permissions based on their role
4. **Given** I have collection-level permissions, **When** I try to access a collection, **Then** the system enforces my specific permissions for that collection
5. **Given** I perform any action, **When** the system processes it, **Then** all activities are logged for audit purposes

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user's MFA device is lost or compromised?
- How does the system handle users who leave the organization or change roles?
- What happens when authentication services are temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system handle concurrent login attempts from the same user?
- What happens when a user's permissions are revoked while they are actively using the system?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST require multi-factor authentication for all user accounts
- **FR-002**: System MUST support enterprise SSO integration with SAML, OIDC, and other standard protocols
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement role-based access control with Admin, Analyst, and Developer roles
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide collection-level permissions allowing fine-grained access control
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain comprehensive audit logging for all user activities and system events
- **FR-006**: System MUST enforce robots.txt compliance and domain allow/deny lists for data acquisition
- **FR-007**: System MUST support user session management with configurable timeout and renewal policies
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide user account management including creation, modification, and deactivation
- **FR-009**: System MUST support password policies including complexity requirements and expiration [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific password policy requirements?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide account recovery mechanisms for lost credentials or locked accounts
- **FR-011**: System MUST support API token authentication for programmatic access [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific token types and expiration policies?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide compliance features including data access reporting and user activity monitoring
- **FR-013**: System MUST support user group management for bulk permission assignment and management
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide authentication analytics including login patterns, failed attempts, and security events

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Account**: Represents a user's identity with authentication credentials, roles, and profile information
- **User Role**: Represents a predefined set of permissions and capabilities assigned to users
- **Permission**: Represents specific access rights for collections, features, or system functions
- **Audit Log**: Represents a record of user activities and system events for compliance and security
- **Authentication Session**: Represents an active user session with authentication state and permissions
