# Feature Specification: Citadel User Interface

**Feature Branch**: `citadel-user-interface`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Graphical User Interface with direct data acquisition initiation, named collections, provenance in responses, real-time progress monitoring, guided user workflows, and collaborative features through LiveKit integration"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí User interface requirements for Citadel V2 identified
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: users, UI interactions, data display, real-time features, collaboration
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User interface workflows and acceptance criteria defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a business user**, I want to initiate data acquisition through a graphical interface so that I can collect and organize information from various sources without needing technical expertise or command-line tools.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am logged into Citadel, **When** I click "Start New Acquisition", **Then** I see a guided workflow interface
2. **Given** I am on the acquisition setup page, **When** I select "Website Crawling" and enter a URL, **Then** I can specify collection name and description
3. **Given** I have started an acquisition job, **When** I view the progress page, **Then** I see real-time updates with progress bars and status messages
4. **Given** I have completed an acquisition, **When** I view the collection, **Then** I see all documents with source references and timestamps
5. **Given** I am collaborating with a team member, **When** we both view the same acquisition, **Then** we see synchronized real-time updates

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the acquisition fails partway through?
- How does the interface handle very large collections with thousands of documents?
- What happens when multiple users try to modify the same collection simultaneously?
- How does the system handle network interruptions during real-time updates?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a web-based graphical interface accessible through standard browsers
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to initiate data acquisition through point-and-click interface without command-line tools
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide guided workflows for different acquisition types (sitemap, recursive crawling, file upload)
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to specify collection names and descriptions during acquisition setup
- **FR-005**: System MUST display real-time progress indicators with progress bars and status messages
- **FR-006**: System MUST show comprehensive status updates including fetching, vectorizing, and analysis stages
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide end-of-acquisition summaries with pages crawled, time elapsed, and success rates
- **FR-008**: System MUST display provenance information including source references, timestamps, and collection relationships
- **FR-009**: System MUST support collaborative features allowing multiple users to monitor the same acquisition simultaneously
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide voice-driven search and query capabilities [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific voice commands and languages supported?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST enable real-time data synchronization between collaborating users
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide workspace customization including saved queries, favorite collections, and personalized dashboards
- **FR-013**: System MUST support role-based interfaces tailored for business users, analysts, and developers [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific role differences and permissions?]
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide notification systems for new data ingestion, system updates, and relevant content [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: notification delivery methods and user preferences?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Session**: Represents active user interaction with the interface, including authentication state and preferences
- **Acquisition Job**: Represents a data acquisition task with status, progress, and configuration parameters
- **Collection View**: Represents the display of a named collection with documents, metadata, and provenance information
- **Progress Event**: Represents real-time status updates during acquisition with timestamps and detailed information
- **Collaboration Session**: Represents shared viewing experience between multiple users with synchronized updates
