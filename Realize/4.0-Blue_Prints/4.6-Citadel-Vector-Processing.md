# Feature Specification: Citadel Vector Processing

**Feature Branch**: `citadel-vector-processing`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Smart content chunking and vector embedding system with hierarchical Markdown splitting, semantic boundary detection, embedding generation, vector database storage, and optimization for retrieval performance"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Vector processing requirements for Citadel V2 identified
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: users, content processing, chunking, embeddings, vector storage, optimization
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Vector processing workflows and acceptance criteria defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a knowledge engineer**, I want content to be intelligently processed and optimized for search so that users can find relevant information quickly and accurately through semantic similarity.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have acquired a document, **When** the system processes it, **Then** content is split into optimal chunks based on document structure
2. **Given** I have processed content, **When** the system generates embeddings, **Then** each chunk is converted to a vector representation for semantic search
3. **Given** I have vectorized content, **When** I perform a search, **Then** the system finds semantically similar content across all collections
4. **Given** I have different document types, **When** the system processes them, **Then** each type is handled with appropriate chunking strategies
5. **Given** I have processed content, **When** I view the results, **Then** I can see how content was chunked and understand the processing decisions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a document is too large to process in memory?
- How does the system handle documents with complex formatting or mixed content types?
- What happens when embedding generation fails for certain content?
- How does the system handle documents in different languages or character encodings?
- What happens when vector storage becomes full or reaches capacity limits?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST implement hierarchical Markdown chunking based on header structure and document organization
- **FR-002**: System MUST detect semantic boundaries to create meaningful content segments
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate vector embeddings for all processed content chunks
- **FR-004**: System MUST store vector embeddings in a distributed vector database for fast retrieval
- **FR-005**: System MUST optimize chunk sizes for retrieval performance balancing granularity and context
- **FR-006**: System MUST support different chunking strategies for different document types and formats
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain metadata linking chunks back to original documents and source information
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide chunking quality metrics and allow users to review processing decisions
- **FR-009**: System MUST support embedding model updates and re-processing of existing content [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific update process and backward compatibility?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle large documents through streaming processing and memory management
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide vector similarity search capabilities across all processed content
- **FR-012**: System MUST support batch processing for efficient handling of large document collections
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain vector database performance through indexing and optimization [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific optimization strategies and performance targets?]
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide vector processing analytics including processing speed, quality metrics, and storage utilization

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Content Chunk**: Represents a processed segment of content with metadata, embeddings, and source references
- **Vector Embedding**: Represents the mathematical representation of content for semantic similarity calculations
- **Chunking Strategy**: Represents the processing approach used for different document types and formats
- **Processing Metadata**: Represents information about how content was processed including quality metrics and decisions
- **Vector Index**: Represents the optimized storage structure for fast similarity search and retrieval
