# Feature Specification: Citadel Progress Monitoring

**Feature Branch**: `citadel-progress-monitoring`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Real-time progress monitoring system with live status displays, progress bars, comprehensive status updates, automated reporting, end-of-acquisition summaries, and collaborative monitoring capabilities"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Progress monitoring requirements for Citadel V2 identified
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: users, progress tracking, status updates, reporting, collaboration
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Progress monitoring workflows and acceptance criteria defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a data acquisition manager**, I want to monitor the progress of data acquisition operations in real-time so that I can track completion status, identify issues, and provide updates to stakeholders.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have started a data acquisition job, **When** I view the progress page, **Then** I see real-time progress bars and status messages
2. **Given** I am monitoring an acquisition, **When** the system processes documents, **Then** I see detailed status updates for fetching, vectorizing, and analysis stages
3. **Given** I have multiple acquisition jobs running, **When** I view the dashboard, **Then** I see all active jobs with their current status and progress
4. **Given** an acquisition job completes, **When** I view the summary, **Then** I see pages crawled, time elapsed, success rates, and any errors encountered
5. **Given** I am collaborating with team members, **When** we monitor the same acquisition, **Then** we see synchronized real-time updates

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the progress monitoring system loses connection during an acquisition?
- How does the system handle very long-running acquisitions that span multiple days?
- What happens when an acquisition fails partway through - how is progress preserved?
- How does the system handle multiple users monitoring the same acquisition simultaneously?
- What happens when the progress data becomes corrupted or inconsistent?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide real-time progress bars showing completion percentage for all active acquisition jobs
- **FR-002**: System MUST display comprehensive status updates including fetching, vectorizing, and analysis stages
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide live status messages with detailed information about current processing steps
- **FR-004**: System MUST support monitoring of multiple concurrent acquisition jobs simultaneously
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide automated end-of-acquisition summaries including pages crawled, time elapsed, and success rates
- **FR-006**: System MUST display error information and failure details when acquisitions encounter problems
- **FR-007**: System MUST support collaborative monitoring allowing multiple users to view the same acquisition progress
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide progress history and allow users to review past acquisition runs
- **FR-009**: System MUST send notifications when acquisitions complete, fail, or encounter significant issues [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: notification delivery methods and user preferences?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide progress export capabilities for reporting and analysis [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: export formats and data included?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST support progress filtering and search based on job status, time range, and user [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific filtering criteria and search capabilities?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain progress data integrity even during system interruptions or failures
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide performance metrics including processing speed, throughput, and resource utilization
- **FR-014**: System MUST support progress monitoring for different acquisition types with type-specific status information [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific status information per acquisition type?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Progress Event**: Represents a real-time status update with timestamp, stage, and detailed information
- **Acquisition Job**: Represents an active data acquisition task with current status, progress, and metadata
- **Progress Summary**: Represents end-of-acquisition reporting with statistics, metrics, and completion details
- **Monitoring Session**: Represents a user's active monitoring of one or more acquisition jobs
- **Collaboration Session**: Represents shared monitoring between multiple users with synchronized updates
